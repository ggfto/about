# Hello World!

I'm Gabriel Guimaraes, and here we have one of my hobbies and also my daily job!

## About me
I'm a Eletrocnics Technician, graduated in SENAI class of 2011/2013.

Since I was a child I've been fascinated with technology and always wondered what could I do with it. At the age of 13 I won my first computer as a gift from my father and then my journey started. With 14 years I learned how to install multiple operational systems, with emphasis in windows. With 18 years, I started working with Access Control equipment and also Industrial Automation. One year later, I started to develop in Delphi/Pascal, building only custom reports for customers of the company. Some time in 2010, I also started to build softwares related to Access Control and providing support on field and some administrative tasks. 9 years passed like this. In the meantime, I developed skills with SQL, CSS, HTML, Firewalls, Linux OS, VPNs, etc.

In 2019 I decided to take an opportunity as a Full time Delphi developer, this consequently brought me to the JAVA world after 9 months, till now. I've also developed some docker skills, something that I'm loving the experience and using it more everyday.

At the beginning of June of 2020 I started a hobby project with a friend, it consists of building a GTAV RP server, that's when Lua came to my life.
